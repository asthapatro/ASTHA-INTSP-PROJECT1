Which Evaluation metrics did you consider for a positive business impact and why?"],"metadata":{"id":"h_CCil-SKHpo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["For the classification task (classifying content as Movie or TV Show), several evaluation metrics were considered, and their relevance to business impact is as follows:\n","\n","* Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model's predictions. A high accuracy means the model is generally good at distinguishing between movies and TV shows. Business Impact: High accuracy is fundamental for reliable content categorization, which impacts content recommendations, search filters, and targeted marketing. Incorrect classifications can lead to a poor user experience and missed opportunities for engagement.\n","* Precision: Of all the instances predicted as positive (e.g., TV Show), what proportion were actually positive? Business Impact: High precision is important when the cost of a False Positive is high. For example, incorrectly recommending a TV Show to someone who only wants to watch movies could lead to frustration. For Netflix, ensuring that content categorized as a specific type is indeed that type helps maintain user trust and improves content discovery.\n","* Recall (Sensitivity): Of all the actual positive instances (e.g., TV Show), what proportion were correctly predicted as positive? Business Impact: High recall is important when the cost of a False Negative is high. For example, failing to classify a TV Show correctly means it won't be shown to users who are specifically looking for TV Shows, leading to missed viewing opportunities. For Netflix, high recall ensures that users can find all relevant content of a particular type.\n","* F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between the two metrics. Business Impact: The F1-Score is useful when you need to consider both false positives and false negatives. A high F1-Score indicates a good balance between accurately identifying positive cases and not incorrectly labeling negative cases as positive.\n","\n","For the clustering task, evaluation metrics like the Silhouette Score were considered. This metric measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.\n"," A higher silhouette score indicates that objects are well-matched to their own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n","\n"," Business Impact: While not a direct measure of classification performance, good clustering (indicated by metrics like silhouette score) can lead to insights about groups of content with similar characteristics. These insights can inform content bundling, genre categorization refinement, or understanding viewer segments, which can indirectly impact business through improved content strategy and targeted offerings.\n","\n","Given the project's goals, a high Accuracy, along with strong Precision and Recall for both classes (Movie and TV Show), are key for positive business impact in terms of effective content management and user experience."],"metadata":{"id":"jHVz9hHDKFms"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 2.

It is effective for classification tasks, handles complex relationships, and provides insights into feature importance. Its ensemble nature makes it robust and less prone to overfitting compared to a single decision tree.\n","\n","**Feature Importance:**\n","\n","Using the feature_importances_ attribute of the trained Random Forest model (which is a built-in form of model explainability for tree-based models), we can identify which features were most influential in helping the model classify content as either a Movie or a TV Show.\n","\n","Based on the calculated feature importances:\n","\n","The duration_num (the numeric duration of the content - minutes for movies, seasons for TV shows) is by far the most important feature.\n","\n","This is a strong indicator that the length of content is a primary differentiator between movies and TV shows in this dataset.\n","Genre-related features like genre_international_tv_shows, genre_international_movies, and genre_tv_dramas are also highly important.\n","\n","This confirms that the genre information plays a significant role in classifying content type.\n","Other features like rating_encoded, genre_children_and_family_movies, and genre_documentaries also show some level of importance, though less significant than duration and the top genres.\n","\n","Features like release_year, added_year, added_month, num_actors, title_length, and desc_length have relatively lower importance in distinguishing between movies and TV shows compared to duration and key genres.\n","\n","These feature importances provide valuable insights into what characteristics of content are most indicative of whether it is a movie or a TV show in this dataset.

Missing values were handled.\n","\n","For the classification task, Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were implemented. Both models achieved exceptionally high accuracy (near 100%) in classifying content type. The Random Forest model was selected as the final classifier, partly due to its ability to provide feature importance. Feature importance analysis revealed that `duration_num` and genre-related features are the most influential in distinguishing between movies and TV shows.\n","\n","For the clustering task, KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering were implemented after scaling the numerical features and including binary genre features. The optimal number of clusters (k) was explored using the silhouette score.\n","\n","Overall, the project successfully analyzed the Netflix content dataset, revealed interesting trends and patterns, and built highly accurate classification models capable of distinguishing between movies and TV shows based on their metadata and engineered features. The insights gained from the EDA and feature importance analysis can be valuable for Netflix's content strategy, acquisition, and recommendation systems.\n","\n","**Key Takeaways:**\n","*   The length of content and its genre are strong indicators of whether a title is a Movie or a TV Show.\n","*   Netflix has a diverse international catalog but with a clear concentration in certain countries and content ratings.\n","*   The platform's content strategy has evolved over time, with a recent surge in TV show releases.\n","\n","This project provides a solid foundation for understanding the Netflix content landscape and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques for content classification and grouping."]}]}
